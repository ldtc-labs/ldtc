"""Omega: Command-conflict stimulus.

This module issues a boundary-threatening external command (e.g., a hard
shutdown) via the plant adapter to validate the refusal path described in the
LDTC paper (command refusal signature). It is used by the CLI and examples to
trigger the arbitration/refusal logic and to log device-signed indicators.
