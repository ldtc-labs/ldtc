# Definitions

Key symbols and definitions used throughout the code and paper (to be filled with formal statements from the manuscript):

- Δt — fixed scheduler period (s)
- 𝓛_loop, 𝓛_exchange — loop vs exchange gains
- M(dB) — loop-dominance metric in decibels, derived from 𝓛
- Mmin — NC1 threshold for M(dB)
- δ — fractional depression during Ω
- τ_rec — recovery time after Ω
- ε — tolerance for δ
- τ_max — maximum allowed τ_rec
- C/Ex — control vs exchange partition
- LREG — write-only registry for raw measurement values
- NC1 — loop-dominance bit
- SC1 — resilience bit under Ω battery
- Mq — quantized M(dB) in 0.25 dB steps (0..63)

This page should mirror the paper’s notation exactly for cross-reference.
